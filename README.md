# Sales-Complete-Project
I developed a comprehensive Project about “Sales Performance” in Excel, Creating Multiple Modern Dashboards and Tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.
## Dataset used

## Questions (KPIs)
-	Month wise New Clients
-	Regular Clients Percent
-	Department wise Sales
-	Month wise Sales and Costs
-	Yearly Sales
-	Top- Products
-	Customer wise Average Checks/Bills

-	## Dashboard Interaction
-	Dashboard Interaction <a href= “https://github.com/Muhammad-Jan/Sales-Complete-Project/blob/main/Home%20Store%20Sales%20Performance.xlsx”> Home-Store-Sales-Performance</a>
## Process
-	Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
-	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
-	Created Pivot tables according to the questions asked.
-	Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

# Sales Performance Analysis Project

I developed a comprehensive **Sales Performance Analysis Project** in Excel, creating multiple modern dashboards and tables to analyze and visualize sales data. This project involved several stages, including **data preprocessing**, **data cleaning**, and **data visualization**, to ensure accurate and insightful results.

## Dataset Used
- **Dataset:** [Home Store Sales Performance Dataset](https://github.com/Muhammad-Jan/Sales-Complete-Project/blob/main/Home%20Store%20Sales%20Performance.xlsx)

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Month-wise New Clients:** Track the number of new clients acquired each month.
2. **Regular Clients Percentage:** Analyze the percentage of returning clients.
3. **Department-wise Sales:** Compare sales performance across different departments.
4. **Month-wise Sales and Costs:** Visualize monthly sales revenue and operational costs.
5. **Yearly Sales:** Summarize total sales for the year.
6. **Top Products:** Identify the best-selling products.
7. **Customer-wise Average Checks/Bills:** Calculate the average spending per customer.
8. **Inventory vs. Sales Performance:** Compare inventory levels with sales performance.

## Dashboard Interaction
- **Interactive Dashboard:** [Home Store Sales Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/Muhammad-Jan/Sales-Complete-Project/blob/main/Home%20Store%20Sales%20Performance.xlsx)
  - The dashboard is equipped with **slicers** and **dynamic filters** to allow users to interact with the data and gain insights based on specific criteria.

## Process
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Verified the dataset for missing values, anomalies, and inconsistencies.
   - Ensured data consistency in terms of data types, formats, and values.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed duplicates and corrected errors in the dataset.
   - Standardized data entries for accurate analysis.
3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Created **Pivot Tables** to summarize and analyze data based on the KPIs.
   - Used **Excel formulas** and **functions** to calculate metrics like average checks, regular clients percentage, etc.
4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Designed **modern dashboards** using Excel charts, graphs, and tables.
   - Merged all Pivot Tables into a single dashboard for a unified view.
   - Added **slicers** to make the dashboard interactive and user-friendly.
